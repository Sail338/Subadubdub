Ben: Leslie, go home.
Leslie: No, I can't. I can't go home. I have to get ready for the Chamber of Secrets.
Ben: Commerce.
Leslie: If this meeting does not go perfectly, then the Harvest Festival is going to be over before it  begins. I cannot go home.
Ben: Okay, then, who's your doctor? 
Leslie: Ann's my doctor. And she's the most beautiful nurse in the world.
Ben: Come on.
Leslie: Oh, God. Now, I'm hot. Now, it's really hot in here.
Ben: Okay, well, that's your fever.
Andy: Leslie, I typed your symptoms into the thing up here, and it says you could have 'network connectivity problems'.
