Cop Rick: Why am I still here? I already confessed to everything.
Officer Rick 1: Your case has been reviewed. *presses button, unlocks Cop Rick's handcuffs* You're free to go.
Cop Rick: But... I violated at least a dozen departmental codes!
Officer Rick 1: New department. New codes. *leaves room*
Officer Rick 2: New Citadel. *leaves with Officer Rick 1*
[Trans. Ext. Morty Academy]
(Teacher Rick locks the main entrance when Glasses, Lizard and Fat Morty arrive back to him.)
Glasses Morty: Did we miss graduation? Where are the new Ricks?
Teacher Rick: No graduation. No new Ricks. The school's curriculum is changing.
Glasses Morty: To what?
Teacher Rick: I don't know, and I don't have to know. I've been fired. *takes out a flask, unscrews top and walks off* Good luck, turds.
Lizard Morty: Holy crap... Slick's wish came true. *sees Glasses and Fat Morty smiling*
[Trans. Shadow Council of Ricks Hall]
(Rick D. Sanchez III arrives to take his seat next to Steve Jobs Rick.)
Rick D. Sanchez III: Sorry I'm late, Mr. President. Had a little crisis at work.
Steve Jobs Rick: Worth it! *eats Simple Rick wafer cookie; see President Morty having a haircut with Barber Rick*
President Morty: It's no problem. *to Barber Rick* Uh, a little more off the top. *continues* You were saying, Garment District Rick?
Garment District Rick: We were saying, *air-quotes* "President Morty," that we don't care who sits in that seat. A Rick, a Morty, a goddam Jerry, doesn't matter. We've been running the Citadel since before the Council, and you'll find that we're still running it now. *President Morty turns over holding a mirror*
President Morty: Does he really speak for everyone here?
Other Ricks: Yeah, yeah. *President Morty turns back again holding up the mirror*
President Morty: Well, I think it's important to be clear. Raise your hand if he speaks for you.
(Through President Morty's mirror reflection, seven Ricks including Rick D. Sanchez III and Garment District Rick raise their hands for a beat. President Morty snaps his finger and two Officer Ricks euthanise the five Ricks with shock lasers expect for Steve Jobs Rick and Good-Looking Rick.)
Barber Rick: *keeping his cool* Is that... enough off the top? *three more Officer Ricks enter*
President Morty: I don't know. *turns over the two remaining Ricks* Is it?
Steve Jobs Rick: *begging* Yes, yes, yes! Goddamn yes!
Good-Looking Rick: *begging* Yes, it's great!
President Morty: Good.
(President Morty then walks over to pour a glass of brandy as the Officer Ricks and Mortys carry the Rick corpses away. President Morty observes outside the window as he continues his dialogue.)
President Morty: This seems like a good time for a drink, and a cold, calculated speech with sinister overtones. A speech about politics, about order, brotherhood, power...
(Scenes show the new Morty/Rick banners covering the old Rick emblems of a building; Cop Rick putting on his new police badge; Fat, Glasses and Lizard Morty wheelbarrowing Megafruit in their new uniforms; Officer Ricks dragging the remaining dead Ricks into airlock pods. Cut back to President Morty.)
President Morty: But speeches are for campaigning. *looks into his glass of brandy and gives a sinister expression* Now... is the time for action.
